# vouchers App
this is an assessment project that I did it for tigerlab malaysia

![vocher django app demo](/doc/voucher-demo.gif)

## Requirement
I would like to have a form to enter my voucher code. The form will then shows me if the voucher code is valid or not, and also shows me how much discount will I get. The discount value can be in "RM 10" or "10% off". 

## Bonus if can be done:
- Each voucher code can be used 3 times only. That's mean if I submit the same voucher code in the form more than 3 times, it should shows that the voucher is invalid.

## #Steps
1. apply migration
2. create users
3. run the app

# TODO and furthure upgrades
[] follow PEP 8 rules
[] add requirements.txt
[] add docstrings
[] add test cases
